This made it very challenging to wrap my head around how to solve the problem of grabbing a rotating object with oculus touch controllers and offering accurate and intentful controls to the VR Drive framework. After many failed models, I finally was able to come up with a solution that delivered 1 to 1 steering interaction. The final solution relied on simplifying the sensor input from the oculus touch controllers once the player grabs the steering wheel. Also, care had to be taken to support both one handled and two handed steering behavior. In the end, I mapped the oculus touch controllers\u2019 inputs to the local space of the in-game steering wheel and calculated angle differences every frame. A run-through of the steering behavior goes as follows: If gripping gesture detected -> if holding steering wheel -> calculate rotation difference per hand based on the steering wheel -> apply rotation to steering wheel -> rotate wheels of the vehicle -> repeat. Also, in order to create the illusion that the player was gripping the steering when, I locked the view models for the oculus controllers when a grip of the steering wheel has been initiated. This made it easier to feel like players were actually steering the car because they didn\u2019t get incorrect visual cues from the view models going off the steering wheel and occasionally changing depth. All in all, the steering experience felt very realistic."),Re("Gamemodes","In order to supply some game-making inspiration to those who might use my VR Drive framework, I supplied the basic framework for some game modes with AI cars.

Once the data was fed in (accomplished by using AndroidJNI in Unity), deriving the pedaling gesture was fairly simple.
